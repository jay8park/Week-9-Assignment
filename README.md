# Week-9-Assignment

I tried deploying Dionaea over HTTP. 

# Issues Encountered
I encountered SO many issues. Setting up and installing from Milestone 2 was difficult. Had problems accessing the console on browser because my user/email and password never really registered so had to re-install. Also, I couldn't really load the external IP of the admin VM, and kept telling me Gateway/timeout error.
